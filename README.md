- Final Project: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%

## Programming Assignments
The best way to learn programming is through practice. There will be weekly programming assignments. All assignments will be committed to github by the specified deadline. You may work in pairs to complete these assignments, but if you do, make sure to have each person commit a solution to at least one problem. It is in your best interest to understand the solutions to each problem.

Assignments will be graded with the following criteria:
- Output: 50%
- Code Quality: 50%  

Note: Late submissions will receive a 10% deduction to the final grade for the assignment.
